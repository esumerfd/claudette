## Design Resources

### Reference Builds
This project draws inspiration from existing articulated helmet/mask designs:
- Boxandloop's articulated helmet (Thing:4629346) - excellent mechanical reference
- Various sci-fi helmet builds on Thingiverse/Printables
- Use these as mechanical and electronics integration references
